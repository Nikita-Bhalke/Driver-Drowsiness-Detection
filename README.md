🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection System






A real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection System developed using Python and OpenCV to enhance road safety by detecting signs of driver fatigue.

The system monitors eye movements through a webcam and triggers an alert when drowsiness is detected.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection

Eye detection and monitoring

Drowsiness detection using EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)

Alert system (sound alarm)

Improves road safety

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Dlib (if used)

Machine Learning

🎯 How It Works

Captures live video through webcam

Detects face and eyes

Calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)

If eyes remain closed for a specific duration → alarm triggers
